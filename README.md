PixelFed is a federated social image sharing platform, similar to Instagram.
Federation is done using the [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) protocol,
which is used by [Mastodon](http://joinmastodon.org/), [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en/),
[Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/), and more. Through ActivityPub PixelFed can share
and interact with these platforms, as well as other instances of PixelFed. 

**_Please note this is alpha software, not recommended for production use,
and federation is not supported yet._**

PixelFed is very early into the development stage. If you would like to have a
permanent instance with minimal breakage, **do not use this software until
there is a stable release**. The following setup instructions are intended for
testing and development.
